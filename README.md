# Synthetic Fashion Image Generation using GAN (Fashion-MNIST)

This project uses **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)** to generate synthetic fashion images. The model is trained using the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset, which consists of grayscale images of 10 different clothing types. The goal is to create realistic synthetic images of clothing items from random noise.

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to generate high-quality synthetic images of fashion items using a **Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)**. The network consists of two main components:
- **Generator**: Takes random noise as input and generates synthetic fashion images.
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates whether the generated images are real (from the dataset) or fake (generated by the model).

## Dataset

This project uses the **Fashion-MNIST** dataset, which includes 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 different fashion items (e.g., T-shirts, pants, sneakers). The dataset is divided into training and test sets.

The classes in the dataset are:
- T-shirt/top
- Trouser
- Pullover
- Dress
- Coat
- Sandal
- Shirt
- Sneaker
- Bag
- Ankle boot

The dataset is publicly available from [Fashion-MNIST]

## Model Architecture

The GAN consists of two primary components:

1. **Generator**: 
   - The generator network takes random noise (latent vector) and learns to map it into a high-dimensional image space. 
   - It uses dense layers and deconvolution operations to upsample the noise to create fashion images.

2. **Discriminator**:
   - The discriminator is a convolutional neural network (CNN) that classifies images as either "real" (from the dataset) or "fake" (generated by the generator).
   - It uses convolutional layers to extract features from images and outputs a probability score indicating whether the image is real or fake.

### GAN Architecture Overview:
- **Generator**: 
  - Input: Random noise vector
  - Output: Generated fashion image
  - Layers: Dense, Reshape, Transpose Convolutional layers

- **Discriminator**: 
  - Input: Fashion image (real or fake)
  - Output: Probability score (real or fake)
  - Layers: Convolutional layers, Flatten, Dense layers
